\section{Syllabus Acknowledgement}

By turning in this assignment, I, Wenliang Sun, acknowledge that I have received and understand the course syllabus information available on \url{sites.psu.edu/psucse597fall2018}. 

\section{Introduction}

My name is Wenliang Sun.  I am a second year master student in the CSE department. My programming experience includes Java-languages.  When I compute, I typically use ACI-b-clusters.  My research is not computational in nature. 


\subsection{Accounts}

I have gotten an account on ACI using \url{https://ics.psu.edu/?page_id=57}.  My ACI username is wzs51.

I have gotten an account on XSEDE using \url{https://portal.xsede.org/my-xsede?p_p_id=58&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&saveLastPath=0&_58_struts_action=%2Flogin%2Fcreate_account}.  My username is nitt25.

I will be making my assignments available using github. My username is Wiliam0617. 

\subsection{My Course Project}

I am currently thinking about choosing Laplaceâ€™s Equation as my $Ax=b$ problem for the semester project. I believe that this will be a good project because
\begin{itemize}
  \item The equation is wide-used.
  \item The equation is various physical fieds.
\end{itemize}


\section{HW 0 Code and Writeup}

You can get my assignment onto ACI using the command:

\begin{verbatim}
git clone USERID@aci-b.aci.ics.psu.edu:/storage/work/a/awl5173/toShare/cse597_fall2018/hw0/psu_cse597-002F18_hw0
\end{verbatim}

* Note, test this with us in class or with another person who isn't in the same group(s) as you.

\subsection{Program overview}

This is a serial hello world program, written in C. There is only one code file. The repository also contains the makefile for creating the executable, a readme, licensing information and the tex file for the write-up.


\subsection{Instructions for running and verifying the code}

\textbf{Creating the executable:}
\begin{verbatim}
module load gcc/7.3.1
make
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Running the program:}
\begin{verbatim}
./wenliang_helloWorld.out
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Expected output:}
\begin{verbatim}
wenliang says "Hello, World!"
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Instructions for compiling the write-up}

I used ACI to compile the document.  You can do this using the command:
\begin{verbatim}
./pdfmake.sh
\end{verbatim}

\section{Acknowledgements}

I would like to acknowledge Dr. Adam Lavely for teaching the course. It is really helpful, I will try my best to learn this course in the semester.
